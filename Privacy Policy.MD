# I do not collect or store your data.

All of your personal information, including item data, is initially stored locally on your device. For cloud backups, Just Flip It! uses Apple's CloudKit service which is entirely outside of my view and control. Item and tag data is automatically synced to their secure iCloud servers as you use the app.

You can delete your data at any time by deleting individual items in your inventory and sold items view or by using the various deletion options found in settings.
